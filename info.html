        WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS TO SHOP FROM SUSTAINABLE COMPANIES?
      </h1>
      <h2 class=description> Companies and manufactures are large contributors to plastic pollution in the ocean. With already 8 million pieces of plastic entering the ocean each day, itâ€™s important that we reduce our consumption by any means possible, including reducing use of products from such companies.

      <h3 class=soda> Coca-Cola </h3>
      <h3> According to Greenpeace, Coca-Cola is the largest contributor to plastic pollution. In their packaging alone, Coca-Cola was found to have created 3 million metric tons of plastic each year. Your soda could be a huge contributor to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - even if you don't realize it. </h3>
      <h3 class=karmacola> Karma Cola </h3>
      <h3> Thankfully, there are companies that are sustainable in their plastic usage. Instead of wasteful plastic packaging for their bottles, Karma Cola uses recyclable glass bottles, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to Coca-Cola.
