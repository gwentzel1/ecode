        <h1 class=intro>Why is it Important for Consumers to Shop from Sustainable Companies?</h1>
        <h4 class=description> Companies and manufactures are large contributors to plastic pollution in the ocean. With already 8 million pieces of plastic entering the ocean each day, it’s important that we reduce our consumption by any means possible, including reducing use of products from such companies. Using products with sustainable and environmentally friendly packaging is a great way to make a difference in reducing plastic pollution.  </h4>

        <h3 class=soda> Coca-Cola and Pepsi </h3>
        <h3> According to Greenpeace, Coca-Cola and Pepsi are the largest contributors to plastic pollution. In their packaging alone, Coca-Cola was found to have created 3 million metric tons of plastic each year. As a global fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, Pepsi has contributed greatly to plastic pollution.  Your soda could be a huge contributor to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - even if you don't realize it. </h3>

        <h3 class=karmacola> Karma Cola </h3>
        <h3> Thankfully, there are companies that are sustainable in their plastic usage. Instead of wasteful plastic packaging for their bottles, Karma Cola uses recyclable glass bottles, making them a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

        <h3 class=candy> Nestlé </h3>
        <h3> In a 2017 beach audit, Nestlé was discovered to be the top contributor to plastic pollution in the Philippines. While Nestlé’s products are found everywhere in daily life, their wasteful plastic packaging has contributed to ocean pollution all across the world. </h3>

        <h3 class=chocolate> iChoc </h3>
        <h3> Instead of eating Nestlé chocolate bars, which are wrapped in plastic packaging, iChoc is a vegan chocolate alternative with sustainable packaging. iChoc uses “natureflex” packaging, which is made from renewable and compostable cellulose, completely eliminating plastic packaging in their products. </h3>
      </div>

      <div class = "sector">
        <h3 class=dairy> Danone </h3>
        <h3> Danone is French company that includes brands such as Activia, Dannon, and more. However, it is also one of the top plastic polluting companies, according to a 2017 audit conducted by <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2018/10/09/globalbrandauditreport/">Break Free From Plastic.</a> </h3>
      </div>

      <div class = "sector">
        <h3 class=yogurt> Liberté </h3>
        <h3> Liberté yogurts are a more sustainable option to brands like Activia and Dannon, which come from the plastic-polluting company Danone. This gluten-free and organic yogurt brand uses reusable glass packaging in some of their yogurts. Their yogurts that do contain plastic packaging are made from polypropylene and are recyclable. </h3>

        <h3 class=products> Procter and Gamble </h3>
        <h3> Brands such as Bounty, Crest, and Always are all under the multinational corporation Procter and Gamble -- a company that was found to have about 1,324 pieces of plastic waste in a mass plastic pollution cleanup. While Procter and Gamble brands may be highly popular and common, they are also unsustainable and environmentally harmful. </h3>

      <div class = "sector">
        <h3 class=stuff> Who Gives a Crap, Georganics, and TOTM </h3>
        <h3> Alternatives to Procter and Gamble brands are Who Gives a Crap, Georganics, and TOTM (Time of the Month). Rather than using Bounty paper towels (which come in plastic), Who Gives a Crap paper towels are made from a blend of bamboo and sugarcane (without harming trees!), and come wrapped in compostable or recycled paper. Georganics makes 100% natural toothpastes that come in compostable, recyclable, and plastic-free containers that serve as a better option for the environment in comparison to Crest toothpastes. Finally, TOTM makes vegan and cruelty-free feminine hygiene products that are made from organic and GMO-free cotton, come wrapped in biofilm wrappers, and delivered in carbon positive sugarcane mailing bags, while Always uses plastic in its products. These companies are eco-friendly and plastic-free, helping the environment. </h3>
